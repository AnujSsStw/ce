    "text": "AWS, And How BYJU's Has Grown With It\nIn this post, I\u2019ll be discussing how AWS is helping BYJU\u2019s with its business by providing them a number of different cloud services, about which I\u2019ll be discussing further at a quite high level.\nAWS, or\u00a0Amazon Web Services, is a cloud service that was founded by the e-commerce giant Amazon in 2006. It was the first of its kind to provide\u00a0Infrastructure as a Service\u00a0(IaaS), with the launch of\u00a0AWS Elastic Compute Cloud\u00a0in August 2006. Due to AWS being the first, and no other competitor existing in the market for the kind of service it provided, it took quite a few years before any AWS competitor arrived.\nAWS Services used by BYJU's :-\n\nElastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\n\nBYJU's website and mobile apps are being hosted on Amazon's EC2 instances. EC2 is a cloud service by AWS that is used to rent\u00a0\"virtual servers\"\u00a0on Amazon's data centers, which can be used to host our own applications, such as a website, or for even training ML models on some of the most powerful compute resources available in AWS.\n\nRelational Database Service (RDS)\n\nAmazon RDS is being used by BYJU's for their PostgreSQL database service, which is also their primary database service. The purpose of using RDS is to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.\nRedshift\n\nRedshift\n as quoted by Amazon itself,\u00a0\n\"is the world's fastest cloud data warehouse\".\u00a0\"But what is a data warehouse\", you ask? In simple words, it's nothing but a large collection of business data, that is quite helpful for an organization in making decisions.\n\nImplementing AWS has been a crucial step in the growth of BYJU's. The edtech giant is able to support more than 15 million users on its website and app, all due to the reliable and scalable cloud environment of AWS, which is able to scale on demand as their business keeps growing.\nRamachandran says,\nWe now have more than 15 million students using the BYJU\u2019S mobile app, and we could not support that number without being on AWS.",

    "text": "You've been approaching Public Speaking wrongly. Here's why\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic speaking doesn't have to be a daunting task. \n\nInstead of seeing it as a necessary evil, consider it as a powerful tool to inspire, educate, and connect with your audience. \n\n\n\nToday! I\u2019ll share with you a game-changing perspective that can transform the way you approach public speaking. \n\n\n\n1). Rather than fearing judgment or trying to impress the audience, focus on authenticity and connection..... Share your story, your passion, and your knowledge with genuine enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n2). Another misconception is the need to be flawless. Imperfection make you human! Audiences appreciate vulnerability and will be more receptive to your message.\n\n\n\n3). Practicing is vital, but it's not just about memorization. Instead, focus on understanding your content deeply, and let your passion guide you.\n\n\n\n4). One common mistake is adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. Understand your audience's needs, interests, and pain points.  \n\n\n\n5). Lastly, don't forget that public speaking is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with practice. Embrace every opportunity to speak, seek feedback, and grow from each experience. \n\n\n\nChange the narrative around public speaking! Embrace authenticity, value connection over perfection, and hone your skill through practice. \n\n\n\nThe world is waiting to hear your voice, so go out there and rock that stage!\ud83c\udfa4 \n\n\n\nFollow me Judith  for tips and tricks on How To Speak 10x better\ud83c\udfa4 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022Hit my Bell \ud83d\udd14 you can\u2019t afford to miss a post.\n\n\n\nPS; Rate Your Public Speaking Skill from 1 - 100 and tell me why you chose that number\ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n#PublicSpeaking #coaching #personalitydevelopment #confidencebuilding",

    "text": "Fiber is Your Friend! Here's Why You Need to Load Up \n\nEating enough fiber is one of the most important things you can do for your health and wellbeing. Here's the deal on why you should aim high when it comes to your daily fiber intake:\n\nFiber aids digestion and keeps things moving smoothly through your system. It adds bulk to stool and prevents constipation. Getting enough fiber also reduces your risk for digestive disorders like diverticulitis.  \n\nFiber helps control blood sugar by slowing the rate that sugar enters your bloodstream after a meal. This makes it especially beneficial for those with diabetes or insulin resistance. \n\nIt lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol by binding to cholesterol and removing it from your body before it can clog your arteries. This supports better heart health.\n\nEating more fiber-rich foods can help you feel full on fewer calories, aiding weight control and loss. The bulk fills you up and suppresses appetite.\n\nHigher fiber intake is associated with a reduced risk for some cancers, stroke, and heart disease.
